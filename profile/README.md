MNE-tools hosts a collection of software packages for analysis of (human) neuroimaging data, with emphasis on EEG, MEG, ECoG, iEEG, and fNIRS data. Limited support for MRI data is also provided, mostly for defining brain surfaces/volumes used to restrict inverse imaging of external (MEG) or scalp-based (EEG) data. For more in-depth MRI or fMRI analysis, see http://nipy.org/.
